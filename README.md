## Introduction

Goal: Write an assembler for the VIA C3 Alternative Instruction Set.


In 2018 [xoreaxeaxeax](https://twitter.com/xoreaxeaxeax) gave the talk [GOD MODE UNLOCKED - Hardware Backdoors in x86 CPUs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eSAF_qT_FY). In the talk he explains how he found an undocumented instructions in VIA C3 processors, that could be used in an exploit.

# Work Log
## Day 1: 0.5min
Watched kickoff video and read theme, and browsed the discord. Try the figure out if my initial pre-kickoff idea fitted the theme.

## Day 2: 14h
Decided that I would work on my original idea, because it was something that was on my project todo list for quite some time, and this Jam was good motivation to get started.
First coding session. Setup ASM encoder and decoder, and a very basic assembler. Had a lot of fun, and time flew. Continued way to long into the night.

## Day 3: 2h
Kind of burned out by yesterdays long session, and tired by short night. Also has some other IRL stuff, so no second long session.
Cleaned up yesterdays code and started with work log.
